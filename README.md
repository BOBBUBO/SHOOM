This level has an enemy (`E`) and a treasure chest (`$`). The player must defeat the enemy to collect the treasure.

**Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues with your custom level, try the following:

* Make sure you are using the correct file extension (.sad)
* Check that your level file is properly formatted (i.e. uses `---------` for borders, etc.)
* Try running the game script again with your custom level file

I hope this helps!
